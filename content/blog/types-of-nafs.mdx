### Understanding Nafs


Nafs refers to the <span class="text-blue-500">"soul"</span> or <span class="text-blue-500">"self"</span>, although it is sometimes confused with <span class="text-blue-500">"Ruh"</span>, which is a different concept meaning a "spirit" within ourselves. As we know, the nafs (soul) dies, but the Ruh goes back to Allah. In the Qur'an, nafs is mentioned <span class="text-blue-500 underline-none">295</span> times. The nafs is often described as the seat of desires, emotions, and thoughts, which can incline towards both good and evil, but the Quran conveys the idea that it is something which has to be nurtured and self-regulated, so that it can progress into becoming 'good' and 'inwardly meaningful' through its thoughts and actions.

The Quran discuss various aspects of the nafs, categorizing it into three main types: Nafs al-Ammarah, Nafs al-Lawwama, and Nafs al-Mutma'inna. Each type represents a different state of the soul, ranging from the lowest, most base desires to the highest, most serene state of spiritual contentment.

## 1. Nafs al-Ammarah (The Commanding Self)

Nafs al-Ammarah is the lowest form of the soul, characterized by its inclination towards evil and desires. This nafs commands us and only tells us to do evil. This state of the soul is dominated by carnal desires and selfish urges, often leading one away from the path of righteousness. The sign of having this nafs is the willingness to commit sins and the lack of remorse or guilt for one's actions. We live in a world now where freedom is normal to the point of committing sins passionately without feeling remorse or guilt. If you feel this type of way, then you're in a state of Nafs al-Ammarah.

The Quran explicitly refers to this state of the soul in Surah Yusuf (12:53):

> Indeed, <span class="text-blue-500">the soul is ever inclined to evil</span>, except those shown mercy by my Lord. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (Quran, 12:53)

In this verse, Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) acknowledges the inherent tendency of the soul to incline towards evil unless it is guided and restrained. This verse emphasizes the importance of fighting the inciting nafs.

In another verse, Allah says to hinder our nafs from lust and desires:

> And as for those who were in awe of standing before their Lord and <span class="text-blue-500">restrained themselves from ˹evil˺ desires</span>, Paradise will certainly be ˹their˺ home." (Quran, 79:40-41)

### Characteristics of Nafs al-Ammarah:
- **Dominated by desires and passions**: This type of Nafs seeks immediate gratification and is driven by carnal and materialistic desires.
- **Inclined towards sinful behavior**: It pushes an individual towards actions that are considered sinful and morally wrong.
- **Resistant to spiritual discipline**: It often resists efforts to control or discipline it.
- **Lacks self-control and mindfulness**: It is impulsive and reactive, often acting without consideration of long-term consequences.

This nafs can be likened to a wild horse that needs to be tamed. It is a test for us to overcome these desires through self-discipline, repentance, and constant remembrance of Allah.

## 2. Nafs al-Lawwamah (The Self-Reproaching Self)

Nafs al-Lawwamah represents a more elevated state of the soul, where the conscience becomes active and starts to reproach and blame the self for its wrongdoings. This type of Nafs is aware of its sins and mistakes, leading to feelings of guilt and remorse. In this state, the self is constantly criticizing and blaming the self for committing sins to the point the guilt becomes too much and the self gains its conscience.

Allah mentions this state in Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:2):

> And I swear by the <span class="text-blue-500">self-reproaching soul</span>." (Quran, 75:2)

This verse emphasizes the importance of self-accountability and the internal struggle against one's own shortcomings. The self-reproaching soul is constantly in a state of criticizing, evaluating its actions, and seeking to rectify its faults.

### Characteristics of Nafs al-Lawwama:
- **Conscience-driven**: This Nafs constantly evaluates its actions and feels remorse for wrongdoings.
- **Inclined towards repentance and seeking forgiveness**: It encourages the individual to seek Allah’s forgiveness and strive to correct mistakes.
- **Engages in self-reflection and self-criticism**: It frequently analyzes actions and thoughts to improve oneself.

Nafs al-Lawwamah acts is very crucial, battling the self, guiding self back to the right path through self-reproach and seeking repentance.

## 3. Nafs al-Mutma'innah (The Tranquil Self)

Nafs al-Mutma'innah is the third state of the soul, characterized by peace, contentment, and tranquility. In this state, one is disciplined, trained, and is firm in one's faith and free of sins or bad behavior. This state is attained by those who have reached a high level of faith (Iman) and righteousness (Taqwa). The nafs self is in peace and finds satisfaction in worship and obedience to Allah. The nafs has no desires for the bad; rather, it desires to please Allah.

Allah addresses this soul with honor and reassurance in Surah Al-Fajr (89:27-28):

> <span class="text-blue-500">O tranquil soul</span>, return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him]." (Quran, 89:27-28)

In these verses, Allah invites the tranquil soul to return to Him, fulfilling the promise of eternal reward (paradise). This state represents the believer's spiritual journey, where the soul is free from anxiety and distress, fully trusting in Allah's mercy and wisdom.

### Characteristics of Nafs al-Mutma'inna:
- **Inner peace and contentment**: This Nafs experiences a profound sense of inner tranquility and satisfaction.
- **Strong faith and trust in Allah**: It possesses a deep, unwavering faith in Allah and His plan.
- **Consistent in worship and obedience**: It regularly engages in acts of worship and remains obedient to Allah’s commandments.
- **Free from worldly anxieties and fears**: It is not easily disturbed by worldly concerns and maintains a sense of calm even in difficult circumstances.

Nafs al-Mutma'innah represents our ultimate goal where the soul reaches a state of serenity and is in complete alignment with Allah's will.
